GAME TITLE: Bird Hunters
HOW TO PLAY: Use AWSD or the arrow keys to controll the hunter and kill the birds with your mighty sword. 

Sword and Birds are rigid bodies within the game and when colliding the bird "dies" and disappears. When colliding with the walls/edges the birds will just fly back. 

FUTURE ADVANCEMENTS: Originally wanted to use arrows rather than a sword but the shooting mechanics+physics wasnt in my best knowledge.
